- 👋 Hi, I’m @JasonSmi1
- 👀 I’m interested in cloud computing and Powershell
- 🌱 I’m currently learning a little bit of both, but mostly really C and more skilled in Python + Java.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any webpages that need to be built or projects in python that need help!
- 📫 How to reach me: right here or at my e-mail, jp96smith@gmail.com!
